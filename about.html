                              <p>Angelo Hani, born in 1987 and raised in Beirut by his Armenian mother Jeanine and Lebanese father Tony, comes from a family with a passion for music and art. At an early age, Angelo had an affinity for entrepreneurship and real estate inspired by stories of international industry leaders. He decided to pursue his passion and joined a small brokerage firm at the age of 15, where he gained valuable insights into the real estate market.
                                <br><br>
                                Over the course of five years, Angelo learned a great deal about real estate and contributed to the expansion of the brokerage firm owned by assisting in opening four branches, which grew to become one of the leading companies in the industry.
                                <br><br>
                                Year six marked a turning point for Angelo, and he set out to establish a real estate company of his own with a group of friends. They named the company Etage Et Terre, and within no time, Etage Et Terre Lead by Angelo became one of the leading names in the Lebanese market. His success as a broker extended beyond Lebanon, as he closed deals internationally in countries such as the UAE, Iraq, and Cyprus.

                              <p>Despite the success he enjoyed, Angelo's ultimate goal was to develop and manage real estate projects, which led him to embark on a new journey. He founded Kingsmen Investments, a company that specializes in developing real estate concepts and handles project management, in collaboration with well-known contracting company KEG, led by CEO Jeanpierre Kannan. In just two years, they built and sold over 120 luxury apartments, making them one of the most successful real estate ventures in the region.

                          <div class="faq-body bg-warning text-dark">
                              <p>The year 2019 was a turning point for the real estate market in Lebanon as many investors began shifting their focus to more stable markets abroad. The Lebanese market suffered due to political instability, economic downturns, and a lack of foreign investment. Angelo recognized this shift early on and decided to take action.
                                <br> <br>
                                The trend towards promoting citizenship by investment in countries such as Greece, Cyprus, and Portugal has gained significant traction over the past few years. Investors are driven by the potential of acquiring citizenship in these countries, which comes with a host of benefits such as visa-free travel, access to quality education, better healthcare, and more.
                                <br> <br>
                                For Lebanese investors, this trend emerged as a result of a slowdown in the real estate market in Lebanon in 2019. With the profits gained from a decade-long boom in the real estate sector now shifting to these foreign markets, investors in Lebanon saw an opportunity to diversify their portfolios and explore new investment opportunities.<br> <br>

                            <p>Invited on a trip to Armenia by a close friend. Angelo, who has Armenian roots, joined in out of curiosity to discover more about his mother's homeland. While he didn't expect much from this visit, this trip turned out to be life-changing for Angelo in many ways.
                                <br> <br>
                                Despite being a small country, Angelo saw significant opportunities in Armenia, and decided to open a new branch for Kingsmen Investments there. Many of his friends and colleagues did not understand his decision, thinking he would soon abandon this venture and return. However, for Angelo, every corner of Armenia was a canvas with untapped potential.
