                          <h3 class="faq-page">Q. What are the guarrrantes when i buy a real estate property or i invest online ?</h3>
          
                          <!-- faq answer -->
                          <div class="faq-body">
                              <p>Lacks Transparency. When you are looking to buy a property or invest online, there are three key types of guarantees that you should be aware of. These include bad-boy, payment and completion guarantees. A bad-boy guarantee is a promise from the developer that they will not engage in any illegal activities that could harm the investment. Payment guarantees ensure that investors will receive their payments on time and as agreed upon in the contract. Completion guarantees provide assurance that the project will be completed according to the timeline and specifications outlined in the agreement. 
                                <br><br>

                                Fully Transparent. At Kingsmen Investments, all buyers will receive a comprehensive contract containing all relevant guarantees. Upon purchase of a residential property, the client will directly sign documents provided by the company that owns the Property. For added security, all Proof of ownership will be visible on your Customer Portal. Brand new and clean estate certificates will also be provided, and each document can be verified through the Republic of Armenia’s cadastral website using a unique username and password.   <br><br>
                                
                                On the Same government Cadastral Website you can also access an interactive map add the estate number you have been provided with and get better view about your Location , with the option to view it in three languages: Armenian, English or Russian. A link that leads to the government website will be available inside your Customer Portal; if you are unable to perform any steps yourself, please contact our customer support team for assistance .
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Lacks Transparency. It is important to understand that while some companies may advertise guaranteed returns on investments, these are not reliable. It is important to do your own research and calculations when investing in order to make an informed decision about whether or not it is a good investment for you. Additionally, some lending institutions may accept partial guarantees so if someone owns 20% of the project they can guarantee 20% of the loan amount. 
                                
                                <br><br>
                                Fully Transparent: Kingsmen Investments offers Monthly Returns on Rentals but our returns are never fixed . All our Rented properties are bought via a report provided by our partners at Grand Thornton top 5 Auditing company in the world those financial reports are updated every Year and all of our properties are rented through Airbnb before purchasing any shares in any company that we manage or own that offers monthly returns on rentals that report numbers will be provided to you . Once you purchase those shares you will be granted access to the property Airbnb Account to monitor the flow of your shares minute by minute at the end of the month you will receive the amount directly to your bank account minus managment fees and Government Tax ( Government tax can differ between a company and an other depends on the anual turnover and weather its a VAT Payer company or not . 
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Finally, rental guarantees provided by real estate agencies and property developers can provide investors with confidence in rental income when they purchase a property. However, it is important to weigh both the pros and cons before making this type of commitment as there are risks associated with rental guarantees as well.  <br><br>
